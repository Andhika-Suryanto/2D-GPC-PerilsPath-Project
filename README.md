## 🔴About
**Peril's Path** is a fast-paced 2D RPG that emphasizes quick reflexes and strategic dashing combat. Players journey through dangerous environments, facing waves of enemies while utilizing precise dashes to evade and counterattack. The game eliminates traditional leveling systems, focusing instead on moment-to-moment gameplay where every action counts.

To survive, players can find health and energy pickups scattered along the path, adding a layer of resource management to the experience. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest score by defeating as many enemies as possible while navigating increasingly difficult challenges. With its unique blend of action and strategy, Peril's Path offers an engaging and replayable adventure for players of all skill levels.
